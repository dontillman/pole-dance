  <h1>Root Locus Demo of Real Poles with Feedback</h1>

    A passive filter built with resistors and capacitors will have
    its poles positioned along the negative real axis.  Adding
    feedback will move the pole positions, first along the axis, and
    then off, onto the complex plane.  This is an interactive
    simulation of the root locus movement as feedback is applied.  I
    call it <em>pole dancing</em>.
  </p>


  <p>
    A Super Concise Introduction
  </p>

  <p>
    The transfer function of a filter is described in the form of a
    fraction with polynomials on both the numerator and denominator.
  </p>

  <div class="center">
      \[ H(s) = \frac{z_ns^n + \ldots + z_2s^2 + z_1s + z_0}
                     {p_ns^n + \ldots + p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0} \]
  </div>
  <p>
    Where:
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    \( H(s) \) 
    is the filter transfer function<br />
    \( s \) is the complex frequency \( \alpha + j\omega \) <br />
    \( z \) is the set of numerator (zero) coefficients<br />
    and \( p \) is the set of denomenator (pole) coefficients<br />
  </p>


  <p>
    The numerator determines the overall type of the filter
    (low-pass, high-pass, etc.) and the roots of the numerator
    polynomial are called the <em>zeros</em>.  The
    denominator determines the characteristic shape of the curve
    (resonances, sharpness, etc.) and the roots of the denominator
    polynomial are called the <em>poles</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The poles and zeros can be real or complex, and their
    arrangement on the complex plane is of great interest.  The
    poles have to be on the left half of the plane for stability
    (for it to be a filter and not an oscillator).  Poles on the
    real axis are smooth, gradual filter responses.  Complex poles
    off the real axis are resonant with sharper curves.
  </p>
  <p>
    A passive filter has poles positioned on the negative real axis.
    So there is a class of <em>active filters</em> where a gain
    stage is added to provide feedback around a passive filter,
    altering the pole positions, and liberating them from the real
    axis.  This is called a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_locus">root locus</a>
    in system theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a demonstration of that effect.  Click to place poles on
    the negative real axis of the complex plane.  Then add feedback
    to see how the real poles move around.

  <p class="clearboth">
    What's happening?  Placing the poles along the real axis creates
    a polynomial.  Applying feedback changes the value of the 0th
    coefficent of that polynomial.  The altered polynomial has
    different roots, and those are displayed here.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Primary Feedback slider controls the amount and polarity of
    feedback.  The Secondary Feedback slider applies feedback as a
    derivative and affects the 1st coefficient of the root
    polynomial.
  </p>
  <p>
    Complex poles can only exist in conjugate pairs; mirror images
    on either side of the real axis.  So before any complex poles
    can be created, the real poles have to move around and pair up
    as double real poles.  Only then can they split and leave the
    real axis.  ('Weirdly like sex or cell division in biology.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Some interesting things to note:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      With a single pole, feedback will just move it along the X
      axis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Starting with two poles at the same location, applying
      positive feedback will spread them apart on the real axis.
      Applying negative feedback will release them from the real
      axis for complex poles, vertically, in a line straight up and
      down.  There are similar effects for two poles placed anywhere
      on the real axis.
    </li>
    <li>
      With three poles at the same location, applying negative
      feedback will send two of them toward the Y axis and the third
      will fly to the left.  Positive feedback goes in the other
      direction.
    </li>
    <li>
      For the case of three poles spread out, adding negative
      feedback will bring the rightmost two together first, and then
      they can leap off the real axis, straight lines angled toward
      the Y-axis.  Positive feedback will be the left-right reverse
      behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Moog Ladder Filter has 4 real poles at the same location.
      As negative feedback is added, the poles split apart in an "X"
      shape, and grow from there.  With enough feedback, the pole
      pair on the right side crosses the Y axis, and that's the
      oscillation point.  Positive feedback splits the poles into a
      "cross" shape.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lots of poles at the same location spreads out like a ferris
      wheel.  Positive and negative feedback provide two different
      rotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second feedback slider is addresses the second term, the
      "s" term, of the polynomial.  You see this bahavior on Sallen
      Key filters.  So, starting with a double pole, adding positive
      feedback pops the poles off the real axis.  But this time they
      go off in a semi-circle.  This is effectively a 2 pole filter
      with constant frequency and adjusting the Q.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can use both types of feedback together and get this
      delightfully crazy movement of poles, where a pole on the left
      travels to the right, bumps into the right pole, they split,
      and the rest of the poles move over.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    How it works: Each mouse click adds to a list of real roots.
    Create a polynomial from those roots.  The polynomial gets tweaked
    with the feedback factors.  Then find the roots of the tweaked
    polynomial and present them on the plane.  Plot a frequency
    response curve if the roots are all on the left hand plane.
  </p>
  <p>
    The polynomial roots are found with
